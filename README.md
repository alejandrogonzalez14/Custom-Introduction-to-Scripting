# üéÆ **Custom Introduction to Scripting ‚Äì Part I**  
*by Alejandro Gonz√°lez*

This is my customized version of the [Introduction to Unity Scripting ‚Äì Part I](https://www.kodeco.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-1).

This project was developed using **Unity 2020.2.4f1**.

## üîß **Modifications to the Base Game**

As an addition to the base game created in the Part I tutorial, I have included everything shown in [Introduction to Unity Scripting ‚Äì Part II](https://www.kodeco.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-2) as well. This includes features such as:

- Visual animations for fed sheep.
- Sound effects for a variety of elements.
- Score display on HUD.
- Selectable color of the Hay Machine in Title screen, that carries over to the game.

Lastly, I added my **own** modifications to the game:
- **Variable sheep spawn rate**: now the time between sheep spawn shrinks 1% each time a sheep is successfully saved. It increases by 0.5 seconds when a sheep is dropped, to give the player time to recover.
- **Screen shake**: Added a visual effect of screen shake when a sheep is dropped, to enphasize it more.
